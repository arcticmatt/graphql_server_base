# graphql_server_base

A super basic GraphQL server implemented with Apollo Server. Meant to be used as a starting point for more complex stuff.

## Setup

I followed https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/ to set this up. I put most of those steps into a script so that a project exactly like this can be set up by running

```
./init_script.sh
```

and then populating `index.js`.

## Run the code

Run it with `node index.js`. Then go to http://localhost:4000/graphql to run queries.
