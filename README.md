# graphql_server_base
A super basic GraphQL server implemented with Apollo Server. Meant to be used as a starting point for more complex stuff.

I followed https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/ to set this up.

Run it with `node index.js`. Then go to http://localhost:4000/graphql to run queries.
